                1.Explained:In criticism & lawsuit,debate over coding for kids<br></h2></b>
                <br>
                <b> <h3> (i)Why is learning to code a big deal?</h3></b><br>
                At the turn of this century,when extremely affordable computers made their way into technical and engineering
                colleges across the country,India was able to produce a huge army of coders and programmer--essentially 
                people who could create computer software.As computing devices have taken over every aspect of life,
                the need for good programmers and coders has been increasing relentlessly--and calls to teach coding
                and programming to young students have got louder.In recent years,platforms and companies have 
                started to claim that kids as young as those in elementry school must begin to learn 
                coding.<br><br>
            
      <b>  <h3> (ii)How did the call to start teaching code to children in elementry school come about?</h3></b>
<br>
Since the advent of computers and the arrival of computer coding as the next big thing, leaders of technology
companies around the world have pushed for coding to be included as a subject in middle or higher secondary
school for students who may be interested to learn.In 2018,Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wrote in a blog
post that everyone could benefit from learning the basics of computer science.According to Gates,coding,which
he taught himself and fell in love with at the age of 13,led him to ask questions how to achive tasks,and find
answers to questions."The questions it teaches you to ask---How do you accomplish a task?Can you
find a pattern ? What data do you need?---are useful no matters where you go in life,"Gates wrote.<br><br>
<h3> <b> (iii)What do the critics of code learning at an early age say? </b></h3>
<br>
<p>
    The primary contention against learning to code at a very young age is that some age groups,which 
    are being targeted by platforms,are being pushed into it even before they have mastered the mathematical 
    and technological fundamentals.A metaphor that is often used is that children are being made to ride a bicycle 
    before they have learnt to walk.Software engineer Pradeep Poonia 30,a vocal critic who has become a prominent 
    voice in the debate,says."There's a reason why in mathematics addition is taught first,then subtraction,then 
    multiplication,and then division.It is necessary to learn several elements of mathematics and logical 
    thinking before one can code.(What many of the online platforms are doing these days)is like someone teaching 
    you to draw a car under the pretext of making you learn how to build a car."
